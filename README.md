# Examining-the-Impacts-of-China's-ban-on-Australian-Coal-On-Spot-Soal-Price-in-China's-Market

## Study Description
>With the dominant and special position of Coal in China, the fluctuations in thermal coal’s price will affect many aspects in the society of the country. Many government’s behaviors will directly and indirectly affect the price, and it is necessary for them to identify the magnitude of impacts and then present some adjustments. In this study, I am going to quantify the impacts of China’s ban on Australian coal on the thermal coal price in China’s coal market. The Regression Discontinuity in Time framework will be used, setting the time as the forcing variable. Empirical results are summarized as follows: when including the control variables of coal transportation cost and society’s electricity consumption, the event led to an increase in thermal coal’s price by 44.73 yuan/ton on average, compared with the average thermal coal price before the event. Moreover, the lasting period of impacts is short till January 2021. The main reason for the results is that the event affected the supplies of coal domestically and the demand of thermal coal in China was also very high in the same time period. The core contribution of this study is to help the central government a methodology to measure the impacts of their policies and remind them to establish some prepared macro-controls to sustain the stability of China’s economy.
